# About me
I'm a fourth year's computer science student, passionate about programming.
I'm hungry of new knoledge and technology, fortunately I'm a very fast learner.
I'm mainly intrested in backend programming, but I also find intresting databases or project-managing.

## Why backend?
I have always wanted to be the 'man at the helm', and the backend provides that opportunity. <br>
This is where most of the 'magic' happens.
I'm no stranger to programming the front part of an application and I have nothing against it, it's just that the backend is more interesting. 

## What am I currently do?
I wokring on imporoving my java knowleadge 🧑‍💻. <br>
I am preparing for the exam IZ0-829 (Oracle Certified Profesional Java SE 17 Developer) 👨‍🎓. <br>
In between I am also developing existing projects & thinkig about new ideas 🤓

## My Hobbies
In addition to programming, I also enjoy few other things. For example:
- cycling 🚵‍♀️
- singing - choral and solo 🎤🎶
- strength training 🏋️‍♂️
